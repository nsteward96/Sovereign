===========================
My idea for a senior project. I have spent many hours of my life in browser based games like 
	- Cookie Clicker [Link: http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/], 
	- A Dark Room [Link: http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/], and 
	- Kittens Game [Link: http://bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/].
I want to create a game similar to this, with as much polish as possible, and maybe even host it for other people online to play. This is a good middle ground for someone with my inexperience to play within the boundaries of my knowledge while still being able to produce a quality product. It is a very accessible concept, for both the creator (me) and the consumer (an internet user). 

It will also introduce me to several concepts I have yet to understand:
	- Saving/caching data locally on the user's browser & interacting with it (such as loading)
	- Possibly Angular (I have no experience with it but it sounds like something I can make use of in this endeavor)
	- Starting a Model-View-Controller protocol by scratch utilizing web services like HTML
	- On a lesser note, all the cool things I have never tried before, but that I can probably accomplish (An achievement system, for instance)

The idea for the game is that you are one individual from a nation felled by warring lesser factions who all worked towards your downfall. You were just a townsperson, but you must step up to take reign over a broken land and forge a new kingdom by your hand, starting from nothing and growing a ramshackle township into a thriving civilization with utmost sovereignty.

As I said earlier, I receive much of my inspiration from Cookie Clicker, A Dark Room and Kittens Game. The plan for my game is to align it more with the concepts of A Dark Room and Kittens Game than Cookie Clicker, though Cookie Clicker is the most classic example of a browser game done right, despite being a simple proof-of-concept of a Skinner Box. That's what all of the games boil down to, to an extent. Kittens Game's progression is done at a much slower rate than Cookie Clicker, and A Dark Room is even further different in concept. But in games as seemingly simple as these, it takes this addictive formula to get you hooked, then keeps you coming back for more with their charm and interesting disparities in game mechanics (such as the Grandmapocalypse/Elders in Cookie Clicker and the mysterious Leviathans in Kittens Game, whom not even I have met). 

It is for these reasons listed above that I have made the conscious choice to attempt to mimic the functionality of these games at its base, then hopefully next the polish, and finally its artistic integrity and charm. If I can achieve all of these (somewhat vague) goals, then I will be happy with my project. I may distinguish my criteria in the future.
